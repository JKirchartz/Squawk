Squawk
======

Squawk is a minimalistic 8-bit software synthesizer & playroutine library for Arduino.

The approach to generating sound is very simple - much akin to 80's game consoles.
It follows that Squawk sounds very much like an old-school 8-bit video game.

Why? Because _simple_ is also _fast_.

The library is designed to play music *in the background*.
Simply tell Squawk to start playing, then go about your business and do whatever else you want your sketch to do. The music will keep playing until you tell it to stop.

Depending on the sample rate (quality), Squawk will use between 10% and 40% of the average Arduino CPU time. That leaves you with plenty of room to run your other tasks.

Making music for Squawk
-----------------------

Music is made using a _tracker_ that can handle _ProTracker_ files.
A _tracker_ is a type of music composing software.
_ProTracker_ is a tracker that was popular on the Amiga 500.

If you are unfamiliar with trackers, you will need to refer to the manual for the tracker you choose.

### Tracker suggestions

There are many modern trackers that are capable of composing music in this format.
These are a few:
* OpenMPT
* Milkytracker

### Tracking rules

When tracking your music, start with the template.mod file, and follow a few additional rules.

1. Do not modify the template instruments/samples
2. Only use instrument 1 in channel 1, 2 in ch. 2, and so on
3. Only use even numbers for parameters on volume related commands
4. Don't use advanced looping (regular jumps/breaks are ok)
5. Don't change tempo (changing speed is ok)
6. Put no more than 64 patterns in your pattern list

Have a look at the music in `convert/music` for example ProTracker modules.


Getting your music onto your Arduino
------------------------------------

Squawk requires your ProTracker files to be converted into Squawk melodies.

Melodies come in two flavors:
* As data you put in your sketch to download with your code (see `sketches/Squawk_player`).
* As a file on an SD card connected to your Arduino (see `sketches/SquawkSD_player`).

Both formats can be generated by converter in the `convert/` directory.

If you have an SD card connected to your Arduino, you can also have the Arduino convert your files directly on the SD card (see `sketches/SquawkSD_convert`).


Building the hardware
---------------------

The simplest way of testing things out is to connect a piezo speaker between GND and the chosen output pin. The Squawk_player sketch is tuned to frequencies suitable for a small boxed piezo speaker.

It is also possible to connect output to a speaker system, but this requires a few additional components:

    PIN 3 ____1 Kohm________| |____ AUDIO OUT
              \/\/\/   _|_  | | 1uF
                  20 nF___
    GND   ______________|__________ AUDIO GND

This is a first order low-pass filter to "smooth out" the PWM carrier frequency.
