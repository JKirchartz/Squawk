STEP 1

Track your music using the template .mod file, in any ProTracker
compatible tracker software such as OpenMPT, MilkyTracker, etc.

When tracking, follow a few simple rules:

1) Only use instrument 1 in channel 1, 2 in ch. 2, and so on.
2) Only use even numbers for parameters on volume related commands
3) Don't use advanced looping (regular jumps/breaks are ok)
4) Don't try to set tempo (speed is ok)
5) Put no more than 31 patterns in your order list


STEP 2

After tracking, convert your .mod file using the supplied converter.


STEP 3

Copy the generated data into your sketch and you are ready to go!
