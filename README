STEP 1

Track your music using the template .mod file, in any ProTracker
compatible tracker software such as OpenMPT, MilkyTracker, etc.

When tracking for Squawk, follow a few additional rules:

1) Only use instrument 1 in channel 1, 2 in ch. 2, and so on.
2) Only use even numbers for parameters on volume related commands
3) Don't use advanced looping (regular jumps/breaks are ok)
4) Don't try to set tempo (speed is ok)
5) Put no more than 64 patterns in your order list


STEP 2

After tracking, convert your .mod file using the supplied converter.

There is also an Arduino based converter that performs the
conversion directly on an SD card, but without providing
any form of error checking.


STEP 3

Copy the generated data into your sketch and you are ready to go!
