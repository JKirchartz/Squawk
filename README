STEP 1

Track your music using the template .mod file, in any ProTracker
compatible tracker software such as [LINDE-examples].

When tracking, follow a few simple rules:

1) Only use instrument 1 in channel 1, 2 in channel 2 and so on [LINDE-correct?]
2) Only use even numbers for all volume related commands
3) Don't use advanced jumps (regular jumps are ok)
4) Don't try to set tempo (speed is ok)
5) Only use original ProTracker notes (octaves 1-3)
6) Put no more than 31 patterns in your order list


STEP 2

After tracking, convert your .mod file using the Squawkify.py mod-wrangler:

[LINDE-instructions]


STEP 3

Copy the generated data into your sketch and you are ready to go!
